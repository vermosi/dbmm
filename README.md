# Don't Be Mad, Man...

Don't Be Mad, Man... or 'dbmm' is a project I started to see how I could create a stress relieving website in the smallest way possible.

The goals are:

  - Create a breathing circle animation.
  - 2 HTML files, index and 404.
  - Minify all the things.
  - In the future, add JS to set the background based on:[Time of day, weather in current visitor's location.]
  - Possibly add de-stressing quotes, via API or other means.

### Version
0.0.1

### Tools Used

* Bootstrap - pulled in via CDN
* Modernizr - ditto
* Font Awesome - for the heart, also pulled via CDN
* CSS3 - For animations
* Sublime Text 2 - my favorite text editor
* AWS S3 / Route 53 - to host the static site

### To-Do List

* Add multiple backgrounds based upon:[Location, Time, and Weather]
* Add audio, and audio controls:[Volume Button, start off muted, 3-5 volume levels.]
* Integrate API to pull in de-stress quotes, perhaps new quote every refresh, or a set time variable.
